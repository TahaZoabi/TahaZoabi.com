      Hi, I’m a 25-year-old Software Engineering student who’s really passionate
      about learning how to code. I’ve always been curious about how things work
      behind the scenes in the digital world, and programming has become an
      exciting way for me to explore that. I’m still early in my journey, but
      I’m constantly learning new skills and taking on small projects to grow.
    </p>
    <p class="w-full text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed md:leading-normal">
      Whether it’s building simple apps or experimenting with different
      programming languages, I’m always eager to challenge myself and improve.
      I’m excited to see where this path takes me as I continue to develop and
      learn.
